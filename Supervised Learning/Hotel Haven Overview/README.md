## Business Overview
Hotel Haven is a luxury hotel chain with multiple locations. The hotel offers a wide range of services, 
including various types of rooms, meal plans, and parking options. The hotel struggles with high cancellation 
rates, leading to lost revenue and inefficient resource allocation. The existing system does not provide sufficient
insights into why customers cancel their bookings. The hotel management seeks to predict cancellations based 
on booking data to improve operational efficiency and customer retention.

## Project Objective
Hotel Haven wants to better understand its customers booking patterns and create strategies that could 
improve customer retention and reduce cancellations.

## Data Source
The data set consist of the folowing features;

## Key Insights
Models such as the Logistic Regression model, Random Forest Classifier model, GradientBoostingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier
SVC, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, XGBClassifier were trained on the data set and the best perfoming model was 
selected based on results from the classification report, accuracy score and the confusion matrix.

The Random Forest Classifier Model proved to be the most efficient predictor model with an accuracy value of 92% 
compared to the other models used.	

## Conclusion
With an efficient model trained on the data set, Hotel Haven is able to predict its customer booking pattern 
based on booking data so to improve its operational efficiency and customer retention.
